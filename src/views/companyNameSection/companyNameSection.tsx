        Believe it or not, Taro is a root vegetable. Some of you may know it as
        a bubble tea flavour, a deep fried snack, a part of a stewed meal or
        even as a cake flavour - we think it's pretty cool. Taro grows deep
        underground, spending months developing tonnes of flavour and nutrients,
        hidden away from the world except for its green leaves above ground. Do
        you see where we are going with this? We see it as our responsibility to
        find the "hidden taros" of the world, and felt that the name perfectly
        matched who we are.
